## About this project

- I have been working on making a website, I choose to use bootstrap, because of the essence of time however, I have removed a lot of prebuild javascript component and some of the css, also on that note I have uses sass on several occasions can be found under scss folder, filename _custom.scss and bootstrap.scss. I commeted out some of the javascript components with forward slashes a way to make comments in sass

- Layouting page can be the hardest part in css, it's hard thing to master. Given that I still consider myself a beginner.
